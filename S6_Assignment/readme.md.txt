This code has following steps:

1. Dataloading and Transformation
2. Set-up two models a.Simple Batch Normalization (BN) b. Ghost Normalization (GBN)
3. Set-up the train and Test script
4.Running the test and train script for different models such an BN and GBN
5. For each model, BN and GBN,  it runs different normalization L1, L2 and the combination of L1 and L2
6. The code geberates the accuracy matrix for validation/test data sets for 25 epochs
7. Loss chart for training data sets for 25 epochs
8. The final chart is the 25 misclassification for the GBN model
